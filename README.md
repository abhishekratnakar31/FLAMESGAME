ðŸ”¥ FLAMES

A fun web-based implementation of the classic FLAMES game to determine the relationship between two people based on their names. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

- Simple and interactive user interface
- Real-time result display
- Stylish flame-inspired UI with animated effects
- Logic based on traditional FLAMES algorithm

How It Works

The FLAMES game is based on counting the common letters between two names and using the count to eliminate letters in the word `FLAMES`, which stands for:

- F - Friends
- L - Love
- A - Affection
- M - Marriage
- E - Enemies
- S - Siblings

The last remaining letter reveals the relationship type!
